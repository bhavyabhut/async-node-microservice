# Microservices Architecture

This repository contains an implementation of a microservices-based architecture for a blog platform. The architecture consists of several microservices, each responsible for a specific domain or task.

The following technologies are used in this project:

- **Express** : A web framework for Node.js used to build the microservices.
- **React** : A JavaScript library for building user interfaces used for the frontend.
- **Node.js** : A JavaScript runtime used to run the microservices.
- **TypeScript** : A typed superset of JavaScript used for improved code quality and maintainability.
- **Docker**  : A containerization technology used for packaging and deploying the microservices.
- **Kubernetes** : An open-source container orchestration system used for managing the deployment and scaling of the microservices.



## Implementing event-based communication between microservices:

To implement event-based communication between microservices, each microservice must be able to publish and consume events. The following steps are involved in implementing event-based communication:

**1. Define the event** : 
Define the structure of the event, including its type and any data that it carries. All microservices that consume the event must agree on its structure.

**2. Publish the event** : 
When a microservice produces an event, it publishes it to the Event Bus using a message broker. The message broker ensures that the event is delivered to all the microservices that are subscribed to it.

**3. Consume the event** : 
When a microservice wants to consume an event, it subscribes to the event on the Event Bus using a message broker. The message broker delivers the event to the microservice when it is produced.

**4. Process the event** : 
When a microservice receives an event, it processes it and updates its own state or takes action based on the data in the event.

In this project, the Moderation Service consumes comment events from the Event Bus and processes them to moderate the comments. The other microservices, such as the Posts Service and the Comments Service, also produce and consume events to communicate with each other.




## Microservices
The microservices in this architecture are as follows:

### Posts Service
The Posts Service is responsible for managing the creation and retrieval of blog posts. It exposes a RESTful API for creating and retrieving posts.

### Comments Service
The Comments Service is responsible for managing the creation and retrieval of comments on blog posts. It exposes a RESTful API for creating and retrieving comments.

### Query Service
The Query Service is responsible for retrieving data from the Posts and Comments Services and aggregating it for use in the frontend. It exposes a RESTful API for retrieving data.

### Moderation Service
The Moderation Service is responsible for moderating comments on blog posts. It consumes comment events from the event bus, processes them, and publishes moderated comment events to the event bus.

### Event Bus
The Event Bus is responsible for enabling communication between the microservices. It uses an event-driven architecture to enable asynchronous communication between the microservices. The microservices communicate with each other using events, which are messages that represent a change in state or a request for action. The Event Bus is implemented using a message broker like Apache Kafka or NATS Streaming.


## Getting Started

To get started with the microservices, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies for each microservice by running the following command in each directory:

```
npm install
```


3. Build the Docker images for each microservice by running the following command in each directory:

```
docker build -t <image-name> .
```


Replace `<image-name>` with a name for the Docker image.

4. Deploy the microservices to a Kubernetes cluster by running the following command in each directory:

```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
```


5. Start the frontend by running the following command in the `client` directory:

```
npm start
```


This will start the React development server and open the application in your default web browser.

After following these steps, you should have the microservices and frontend up and running on your local machine. From there, you can make changes and experiment with the architecture as needed.
